      <div>classes that extend properties with features such as thread safety, readonly, observability, help support, parsing.
         You can stack features for settings using subclasses of AbstractPropertiesDecorator, or, more easy by using the Settings annotation
         on a field for your settings. Beware that order is important, for example if you wrap ObservableProperties in ReadonlyProperties,
         notification will never be called.
